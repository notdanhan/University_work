		<h2>The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</h2>
		<h3>By Samuel Taylor Coleridge</h3>
		<hr>
		<p>&nbsp; It is an ancient Mariner,<br>
				And he stoppeth one of three.<br>
				'By thy long grey beard and glittering eye,<br>
				Now wherefore stopp'st thou me?</p>
		<p>&nbsp; The Bridegroom's doors are opened wide, <br>
				And I am next of kin; <br>
				The guests are met, the feast is set: <br>
				May'st hear the merry din.'</p>
		<hr>
		<ul>
			<li>This is, of course, not the whole poem</li>
			<li>It's just two verses</li>
			<li>But I'd recommend reading the rest!</li>
		</ul>
